- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Displays detailed ballot information in a user-friendly format

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- jQuery
- jQuery UI (for autocomplete)
- Papa Parse (for CSV parsing)
- Marked.js (for Markdown rendering)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a web server set up to serve the files (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or a simple Python HTTP server).
3. Place your `data.csv` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the ballot information with columns for state, county, zip, and ballot_markdown.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the search bar to enter a state, county, or zip code.
3. Select from the autocomplete suggestions or press enter to search.
4. View the ballot information displayed for the selected location.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the application
- `style.css`: CSS styles for the application
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the application logic
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing the ballot information (not included in the repository)

## Data Source

The ballot information is sourced from [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/). Please note that this is a beta version, and currently only the top 5 most populous zip codes in each state are available.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the database to include more zip codes and locations
- Add filtering options for different types of elections (local, state, federal)
- Implement a backend API for more efficient data retrieval
- Add user accounts for saving and tracking ballot information
