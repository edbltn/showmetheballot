**Analyze the following ballot text to assess cognitive load and decision-making complexity.** For each indicator, note the relevant findings for clarity:

1. **Technical/Legal Language**: Indicate only if highly technical language is present (boolean).
   
2. **Unique Offices/Propositions**: Provide the count of distinct offices or propositions.

3. **Non-partisan Contests**: Indicate presence (boolean). If present, provide examples. **Ignore ballot measures, and ignore third-party candidates in the presidential race; only identify races where at least one of the two main parties is not present.**

4. **Information Density**: Specify the overall information density as high, medium, or low.

5. **Complex Instructions**: Indicate if there are non-standard voting instructions (boolean). If present, provide examples.

Provide the analysis in the following structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "technical_language": {
    "present": boolean,
    "examples": ["string", "string", ...] // Only include if present is True
  },
  "unique_decisions": integer,
  "non_partisan_contests": {
    "present": boolean,
    "examples": ["string", "string", ...] // Only include if present is True
  },
  "information_density": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "complex_instructions": {
    "present": boolean,
    "examples": ["string", "string", ...] // Only include if present is True
  }
}
```

Ensure that all fields are present in your response, even if some lists are empty.
